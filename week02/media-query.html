        <h2>1 Nefi 3:7</h2>
        <p>7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I 
            will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
            for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the 
            children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that 
            they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

        <h2>Ether 2:25</h2>
        <p>25 And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye 
            cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the 
            waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and 
            the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I 
            should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are 
            swallowed up in the depths of the sea?</p>
